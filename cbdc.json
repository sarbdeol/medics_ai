According to the central bank's researchers, that trial \"highlighted the potential of DLT for certain payment uses, the quick speed with which a system could be implemented, the potential simplicity of smart contracts, and the range of functionality offered by such platforms. Additionally, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston announced it will work with researchers from MIT's Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) on a \"multi-year collaboration\" to build and test a \"hypothetical\" open-source central bank digital currency platform. In a speech announcing this project, Fed governor Lael Brainard stressed that the Fed has still yet to make a formal decision on whether to official pursue a digital currency launch.",

		"description" : "Canada's digital currency initiative is one among a portfolio of contingencies to adapt to any possible scenario, and prepare for the future of money and payments. According to the Bank of Canada, it would consider launching a digital currency if \"the use of bank notes were to decline to a point where Canadians no longer had the option of using them for a wide range of transactions;\" or a competing digital currency were to become a widespread alternative to the Canadian dollar.\r\nIn 2018, the Bank of Canada, Bank of England, and Monetary Authority of Singapore jointly published a report examining alternative models for cross-border transactions. The report looked at three models, one of which used Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency, and concluded \"the models could be used to improve access, speed and transparency of cross-border payments.\"\r\nCanada also piloted Project Jasper in 2017 which experimented with distributed ledger technologies for payments.",

Even though the system was initiated, developed, and for the first few years operated by the central bank, it was eventually spun off and sold to commercial banks. Once debit cards became less expensive and were upgraded to use smart card technology, Avant became obsolete and was shut down",
