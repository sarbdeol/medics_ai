		"Overdose" : "\nBiotin is a water-soluble vitamin, which means that excess amounts are usually excreted through urine and not stored in the body. Therefore, the risk of overdosing on biotin is generally low. There is no established tolerable upper intake level (UL) for biotin, as no adverse effects have been reported even at high doses. However, it is always recommended to follow the recommended dosage guidelines provided by the manufacturer or as advised by a healthcare professional. If accidentally taking a higher dose of biotin, it is best to seek medical advice for further guidance.",
		"Cautions" : "\nWhile biotin is generally safe for most people, there are a few cautions to consider. Biotin supplements may interfere with certain laboratory tests, such as those used to measure hormone levels or thyroid function. It is important to inform your healthcare provider about any biotin supplementation before undergoing any medical tests. Additionally, individuals with pre-existing medical conditions or those taking medication should consult with a healthcare professional before starting biotin supplements to ensure there are no potential interactions or contraindications.",
		"Unlicensed_use" : "\nBiotin is a widely available dietary supplement and is commonly used for its potential benefits in promoting healthy hair, skin, and nails. However, there is limited scientific evidence to support many of the claimed benefits beyond addressing biotin deficiency. The unlicensed use of biotin refers to using it for purposes other than those officially approved by regulatory authorities. It is important to note that the safety and efficacy of biotin for unlicensed uses have not been thoroughly evaluated. Therefore, it is advisable to exercise caution and consult with a healthcare professional before using biotin for any unlicensed purposes."
